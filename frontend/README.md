# Frontend Technical Test

Hello! Thanks for your interest in applying to Zebrands.
As a part of the recruiting process, we ask you to complete this task as a way for you to showcase your abilities and knowledge.

# Description

Develop an application that uses the Github API for searching users and repositories and showing the results in a nice way.
The application must have at least 2 routes: _user search_ and _repositories search_ with the corresponding navigation.
These routes must have a search bar and the search results must appear on the same page.

## What we expect
We are going to evaluate all your choices from design to deployment, so invest enough time in every step, not only coding. The test may feel ambiguous at points because we want you to feel obligated to make decisions. In real life you will often find this to be the case.

We are going to evaluate these dimensions:
- Code quality: We expect clean code and good practices
- Usability: We expect you to build a usable application with a mobile first experience
- Technology: Use of paradigms, frameworks and libraries. Remember to use the right tool for the right problem
- Creativity: Don't let the previous instructions to limit your choices, be free
- Organization: Project structure, versioning, coding standards
- Documentation: Anyone should be able to run the app and to understand the code (this doesn't mean you need to put comments everywhere :))


## Technical Requirements:

Please use React as the base library for this challenge. Beyond that, you are free to use any additional libraries or technologies of your choice.


## Delivering your solution
Please provide us with a link to your personal repository and a link to the running app if you deployed it.
